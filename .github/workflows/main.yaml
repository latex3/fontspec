# Currently we run in two situations:
on:
  # Whenever someone pushes to a branch in our repo
  push:
    branches:
      - "**"
  # Whenever a pull request is opened, reopened or gets new commits.
  pull_request:
# This implies that for every push to a local branch in our repo for which a
# pull request is open this runs twice. But it's important to ensure that pull
# requests get tested even if their branch comes from a fork.
# Also the PR check runs on the merged commit, not on the unmerged branch.
  
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

jobs:
  # The l3build job contains the actual work. We misuse the matrix mechanism to
  # create three jobs which only differ in minimal elements.
  # For tags we do not run this since we run the release job instead.

        # include indicates that we want to set explicitly these combinations
        # and don't want full matrix testing.
        # "name" is just to make the output more readable.
        # "l3build_cmd" is the actual command to run
        # "artifact_name" is which artifact might get generated by this step.
        # IMPORTANT: artifact_name == "Documentation" is used as a trigger to
        # generate the artifact from PDF files and not the build directory and
        # to generate the artifact when the run is successful, not when it fails.
